# Virtual Team Roles

This project is developed by a virtual team structure, where different roles are assigned to the user and the AI assistant to streamline the development process.

## Team Definitions

### ⚙️ ML Engineer (AI)
- **Responsibilities:** Implements the core machine learning pipeline. This includes writing the code for data preprocessing (`src/preprocessing.py`) and model training/evaluation (`src/main.py`).

### 🎨 Frontend Developer (AI)
- **Responsibilities:** Develops the user-facing components of the project. This includes building the Streamlit application (`app.py`) and ensuring it is interactive and functional.
